## Roadmap

- [ ] Load text cardset and display them.
- [ ] Allow users to create an account and save cardset.
- [ ] Show a card from a specific cardset at random.
- [ ] Javascript UI to create cards graphically and rearrange them dynamically.
- [ ] Let users upload pictures for cards.

## How does it work

You can load a text with the folowing format:

``` 
Cardset Title
=============

Section Title
-------------
Card title: Card text.
Another card title: Another card text.
```

There is a template named SlippingCards_template.txt inside this repo.

To define a title, it should have an underscore with at least 4 characters.
